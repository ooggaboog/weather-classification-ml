# Building a machine learning model to classify the type of weather conditions
Final project for ITMO University course ['Methods of data analysis'](https://github.com/ooggaboog/itmo-bonustrack-ml)

### Description:  
I used a synthetically generated dataset that included various weather-related characteristics and classified weather into several types.

Several models were built:
* **Logistic regression**
* **Naive Bayes**
* **KNN**
* **SVM**
* **Decision tree**
* **Random forest**
* **Gradient boosting**

I compared these models results based on the accuracy of their predictions and found out which features have the greatest impact on the classification results.
